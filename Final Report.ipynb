    "Local business entrepreneurs are seeking to opening businesses in downtown Toronto area. They have come seeking advice on where and what type of business they should be opening in downtown Toronto area. If downtown Toronto is overly abundant in numerous business types, they would like to understand where and how far these groupings of businesses are from one another. This will help gauge profitability of the business chosen to develop in the area. "

    "We will be using the Foursquare API to utilize neighborhood information. This neighborhood information will give us the local stores surrounding the downtown Toronto area. We will be able to use a K-means clustering algorithm to group together similar shops around the area. By understanding the similar stores in the area, we can gauge how likely profitability will be from the store groupings in the surrounding area. For example, if there are numerous gyms in the area, we likely wouldn’t open a gym nearby as it would have a lot of competition nearby. "

    "The method used for this analysis was the K-means clustering. We were able to group similar venues in the Downtown Toronto Area to find which types of venues are most popular in different clusters. This allows us to narrow in on a location and determine what people would likely be interested in per given cluster. We were looking for the most popular attraction to potentially bring about the most profit to the business. To condidently choose the most optimal business plan groupings of attactions based on categories were made. There were various categories per cluster so likely we wouldn't want to choose the most popular from each cluster, but the secone or third most popular. "
